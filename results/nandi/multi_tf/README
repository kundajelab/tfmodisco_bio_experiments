multi_tf_18_07_01      initial run, genome-wide
multi_tf_18_07_04      used DeepLIFT scores averaged at each position (merged overlaps)
multi_tf_small         a small dataset (mod 500) for testing purpuses

multi_tf_pre_18_07_06   results include many improvements: 
                        1 pre-trained on union of positives
                        2 fine-tuned on genome-wide data by adding in background
                        3 used averaged DeepLIFT scores
                        4 ran DeepLIFT and MoDISco on test set from union of postives only
                        - did not run modisco with default parameters (used 5mer 1gap)

multi_tf_nb_18_07_09    ipython notebooks to investigate coenrichment of CTCF with SIX5 in the presence of ZNF143
                        based on data from multi_tf_pre_18_07_06
