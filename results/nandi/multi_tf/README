multi_tf_18_07_01,      initial run 
multi_tf_18_07_04,      average scores among overlapping intervals
multi_tf_small,         a trimed down dataset for testing purpuses

multi_tf_pre_18_07_06   results include many improvements: 
                        1 pre-training on union of positives only
                        2 fine-tune to create genome wide model by adding backgrounds
                        3 added the merging overlaps and averaging scores before modisco
                        4 ran deeplift and modisco on chr1 from union of postives only
                        - did not run modisco with default parameters (used 5mer 1gap)

multi_tf_nb_18_07_09    notebooks investigating the co-binding anomaly, the underlying data 
                        are from multi_tf_pre_18_07_06
